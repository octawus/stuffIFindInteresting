Just use [eval()](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#eval) you dummy!!!

Yeah... the idea for this project comes from [CodeWars](https://www.codewars.com/) more specifically [this Kata](https://www.codewars.com/kata/52a78825cdfc2cfc87000005) so basically [eval()](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#eval) would defeat the purpose of the Kata (Oh by the way eval is forbidden by the rules of the creator) and would eliminate any need for learning about the following...

Key concepts: Shunting-yard algorithm, reverse polish notation (RPN), RPN evaluation, unary operators, order of precedence

Basically what I wanted to do is make a convertor that changes infix to RPN in such a way that a somewhat "standard" RPN evaluator (which seems trivial enough) can take care of the calculation. 

Preliminary investigation of the [shunting-yard algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shunting_yard_algorithm) gave me a basic idea of what i wanted to achieve, but that algorithm did not take into account the unary "-" operator which the exercise requires.

So to comply with my self impose restriction of making an output easily readable by a "standard" RPN evaluator I decided to convert negative numbers into "number*-1" (Because * is a common operation for a RPN evaluator). Also, to not have to deal with finding out what each minus will represent during the evaluation of the RPN, I decided that all subtraction will be converted to an addition with a negative number so that the "-" is in the negative number token. After that I have tried to resolve the corner cases that appeared by obliterating an otherwise perfect shunting-yard algorithm with this nonsense.

Also during this investigation some asking has been done to chatGPT (It is not capable yet of generating an answer completely by itself tho). In an attempt to blame myself for it I started [this course](https://www.deeplearning.ai/short-courses/chatgpt-prompt-engineering-for-developers/) (which i have not yet completed T.T) but either by chatGPT or my incompetence an answer has not yet been generated.
